# Cocktail Recipe App

The app dynamically fetches data from a cocktail API to display details such as the cocktail's ingredients, preparation instructions, and characteristics. Additionally, it generates a list of cocktails matching the user's input, and users can click on any cocktail from the list to view its full recipe.
